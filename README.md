# sudukoAid
Just an aid, not a full game player.
2 java source files (Cell.java, Aid.java)
One text file with test case, a specific sudoku (s1.txt)
So far it computes properly, BUT the output is a poorly formatted dump.
The dump is readable enough for me to debug.
STATUS: Computes the notations for each cell, list of possible entries.
NEXT goal: prettify the output.
